#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- Configuration issues
- Non-security bugs with security implications

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Run with Minimal Privileges**:
   ```bash
   # Use sudo only when necessary
   sudo ./iotstrike --hardware
   
   # Drop privileges after initialization when possible
   ./iotstrike --drop-privileges
   ```

2. **Secure Configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "security": {
       "level": "high",
       "memory_protection": true,
       "privilege_dropping": true,
       "secure_logging": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Network Security**:
   - Use isolated networks for testing
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Monitor network traffic during tests

4. **Hardware Protection**:
   - Use current-limited power supplies
   - Implement hardware watchdogs
   - Monitor temperature and voltage

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding Practices**:
   ```c
   // Always validate input
   if (input_size > MAX_BUFFER_SIZE) {
       return IOTSTRIKE_ERROR_INVALID_INPUT;
   }
   
   // Use secure memory functions
   memset_s(sensitive_data, sizeof(sensitive_data), 0, sizeof(sensitive_data));
   
   // Check return values
   if (hardware_init() != IOTSTRIKE_SUCCESS) {
       log_error("Hardware initialization failed");
       return IOTSTRIKE_ERROR_HARDWARE;
   }
   ```

2. **Memory Safety**:
   - Use stack canaries
   - Implement buffer overflow protection
   - Zero sensitive memory after use
   - Validate all array bounds

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Never ignore return values
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Fail securely (deny by default)
   - Provide minimal error information to users

## Known Security Considerations

### Hardware Access Requirements

⚠️ **Root Privileges**: The framework requires root access for hardware interfaces. This is necessary for:
- Direct hardware register access
- Memory-mapped I/O operations
- Real-time scheduling priorities
- Raw socket operations

**Mitigation**: The framework implements privilege dropping after initialization.

### Wireless Security

⚠️ **Monitor Mode**: Wireless testing requires monitor mode, which can:
- Interfere with normal network operations
- Expose sensitive network traffic
- Trigger intrusion detection systems

**Mitigation**: Use isolated test networks and proper authorization.

### Memory Safety

⚠️ **C Language**: Core framework is written in C, which requires careful memory management:
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Use-after-free conditions
- Memory leaks
- Integer overflow issues

**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, static analysis, and runtime protection.

### Hardware Damage Risk

⚠️ **Direct Hardware Access**: Framework can directly control hardware:
- GPIO voltage levels
- SPI/I2C communication
- UART configuration
- USB device interaction

**Mitigation**: Built-in hardware protection mechanisms and validation.

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

1. **Memory Protection**:
   - Stack canary protection (`-fstack-protector-strong`)
   - Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
   - Non-executable stack (NX bit)
   - Secure heap management

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Bounds checking on all inputs
   - Format string protection
   - Integer overflow detection
   - Path traversal prevention

3. **Privilege Management**:
   - Automatic privilege dropping
   - Capability-based security
   - Resource limiting (ulimit)
   - Sandboxed execution

4. **Secure Communication**:
   - TLS encryption for network operations
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Secure key storage
   - Certificate validation

### Compile-time Security

```makefile
# Security-focused compiler flags
SECURITY_CFLAGS = -fstack-protector-strong \
                  -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 \
                  -fPIE \
                  -Wformat \
                  -Wformat-security \
                  -Werror=format-security

SECURITY_LDFLAGS = -pie \
                   -Wl,-z,relro \
                   -Wl,-z,now \
                   -Wl,-z,noexecstack
```

### Runtime Security

```c
// Example security checks
int secure_hardware_init(void) {
    // Check for hardware protection
    if (!check_hardware_protection()) {
        log_security_event("Hardware protection not available");
        return IOTSTRIKE_ERROR_SECURITY;
    }
    
    // Drop privileges after initialization
    if (drop_privileges() != 0) {
        log_security_event("Failed to drop privileges");
        return IOTSTRIKE_ERROR_SECURITY;
    }
    
    return IOTSTRIKE_SUCCESS;
}
```
